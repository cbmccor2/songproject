# songproject
This is to showcase my final project for my Programming for the Internet of Things Course!
The folder here will display the broswer (powered by github) that allows you to control the song via a bluetooth "remote"!
The browser will aid you in how to use the remote!
Please look at the slide deck and the final paper reflection for more information if needed!
